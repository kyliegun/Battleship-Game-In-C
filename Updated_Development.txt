Updated Development Plan - November 27, 2024

Title - Sinking Ships 

Increment 1 - November 27, 2024
The game board of the player showing their ships prints. The player can see the empty board of the opponent and start hitting.
They can enter two coordinates at a time and take two shots at a time.Program can be run from terminal with the computer opponent with flags. 
There is a proper --help option  and documentation. A workflow and test cases are set up for a CI pipeline. There is one computer difficulty 
to play against. There is one level of dificulty for the oponent. Ships are placed randomly.

Work completed.

Increment 2 - Target date December 2, 2024
Program can be run from terminal for two players. Players should be able to place their own ships.
Program should now have different levels of dificulty.

  Lukas: create the new opponent difficulties
  Connor: add more test cases for the new possible constraints and situations
  Kylie: add more flag option handling and ability to play aginst another player
  Alexis: add ability for game to work with a variable sized board
  Shawn: add player ship placemnt choices option

Increment 3 - Target date Dec. 4, 2024:
  Program has statistics and achievements tracked throughout game. Abilities or powerups are added to give players more 
  creative options. Uses sockets to allow play against someone else on the same network (probably won't get this working
  in time). 

  Lukas: working on LAN play
  Connor: helping to set up sockets and more test cases
  Kylie: manage statistics and achievements
  Alexis: add abilities functions to game logic
  Shawn: add player ship placement check conditions to ensure the ships are placed within the board with no overlays.

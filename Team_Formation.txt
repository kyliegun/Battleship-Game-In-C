We're going to make a C app for a battleship like game where you can play against another player or a CPU.
The program will run in the terminal and use ASCII art to display the game state after each turn. 
The player can enter a valid coordinate to fire and the program will check to see if it hits or misses the opponent.
There will be varying opponent difficulty which will determine which AI is used. A player wins when all opponent ships
are sunk.

The functionalities and responsibilities are:
Testing/CI pipeline - Connor
Main - Kylie
Game logic - Alexis
Opponent AI - Lukas

Title of Project: 

High Level Description: Be as detailed as you can for each of the following:
  a. What kind of app, what will it do, how will the user use it?
  b. What is the context in which this app will be used?
  c. What constraints are there on your design?


Each team member describing their role and what they will deliver:

Lukas:


Connor:
I will be in charge of testing and CI pipeline integration. I will set up test cases and ensure that new developments follow the design specs.
This includes making a yml build script to upload the app with GitHub actions. I will communicate with team members to create test cases that are up to
date with development so teammates can test their code as they develop. 

Kylie:
For this team project, I am responsible for the main function. I will be initializing key game elements such as the game boards, 
setting up initial ship placements, and establishing a foundational game structure. Each player will start with an empty board, and 
then proceed to handle the ship placements. I will also be coordinating with other team members, specifically game logic, to successfully 
incorporate functions that are in the game logic program. The program will first call on functions from game logic to initialize the 
empty board. To place the ships, the main program will use functions from the game logic to assign the ships their locations. 
The main function will then go into a loop where players alternately attack each other's boards after ships have been configured. 
Game logic functions will take care of things like hitting and missing, changing board states, and updating player statistics within this 
loop. Lastly, once the game ends, so once all the ships of one player have sunk, the main function will conclude by displaying who won 
and the final statistics.

The Increments (at least 1): What functionality from each team member will be in each 
increment, what is your target date for each increment?

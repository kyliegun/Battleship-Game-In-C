Title of Project: 

High Level Description: Be as detailed as you can for each of the following:
  a. What kind of app, what will it do, how will the user use it?
  b. What is the context in which this app will be used?
  c. What constraints are there on your design?

This app will be a strategic battleship game designed for single player or multiplayer use. Users can play against an AI or friends 
by arranging ships on a grid and taking turns to locate and sink the opponent’s ships. With a simple setup and gameplay, players will 
select coordinates, and track performance statistics, including what they hit or miss, and achievements at the end. A constraint for 
this game would include not being able to place more than one ship on the same coordinates. The ships cannot overlap. Additionally, 
the grid game board has constraints as well, and will need to ensure that ships are placed within grid boundaries. As for gameplay 
constraints, the player can only go once before the next player’s turn.


Each team member describing their role and what they will deliver:

Lukas:


Connor:
I will be in charge of testing and CI pipeline integration. I will set up test cases and ensure that new developments follow the design specs.
This includes making a yml build script to upload the app with GitHub actions. I will communicate with team members to create test cases that are up to
date with development so teammates can test their code as they develop. 

Kylie:
For this team project, I am responsible for the main function. I will be initializing key game elements such as the game boards, 
setting up initial ship placements, and establishing a foundational game structure. Each player will start with an empty board, and 
then proceed to handle the ship placements. I will also be coordinating with other team members, specifically game logic, to successfully 
incorporate functions that are in the game logic program. The program will first call on functions from game logic to initialize the 
empty board. To place the ships, the main program will use functions from the game logic to assign the ships their locations. 
The main function will then go into a loop where players alternately attack each other's boards after ships have been configured. 
Game logic functions will take care of things like hitting and missing, changing board states, and updating player statistics within this 
loop. Lastly, once the game ends, so once all the ships of one player have sunk, the main function will conclude by displaying who won 
and the final statistics.

Alexis: For our Battleship game, the functionality I'm in charge of is the game logic.
The game logic includes setting up the game structure, handling the user’s choices, managing player turns, and determining ship placements. 
This includes implementing functions for initializing the game board, validating player moves, and ensuring that ship positions follow game rules. 
Additionally, I'll manage game states, such as tracking hits, misses, and win conditions.




The Increments (at least 1): What functionality from each team member will be in each 
increment, what is your target date for each increment?
